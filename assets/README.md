This project required me to change the code on this given document. Additionally, I needed to make this code more accesible to those with disabilities. In order to do this, I went through the HTML document and made the code more semantic and easier to understand. Additionally, I went through and added alt's for all of the images which make it easier for people with disabilities to understand. I also went though the CSS style sheet and made it so the code was not as redundant as before.
